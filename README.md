Math   132A   Assignment   4
Due:   Thursday,   February   8th   at   Midnight   on   Gradescope.
Don’t forget you will   not   have a   computer   on   the   midterm   so   it   ’s   important   you   know   how   to   do   these   by   hand   and   calculator.
1.    Recall from class that we discussed   the   general   quadratic   function   f :   Rn →   Rn    deﬁned   by
   
for   an   n   ×   n   symmetric   matrix   Q   and   b   ∈   Rn.
(a)    Prove   that   ∇f   (x)   = Qx   −   b   and   ∇2   f   (x)   = Q.
(b)    Starting from x(0) =   (1, 1.5)T, determine the the ﬁrst three   iterates   in   the   method   of steepest   descent   applied   to   such   an   f   with

starting   at   x(0)      =   (0,   −2).
3.    The   function

is   known   as   Rosenbrock   ’s   function   or   the   banana   function. This   function   is   considered “nasty”   and   is   often   used   to   test   algorithms.
(a)    Prove   that   (1, 1)   is   the   unique   global   minimizer   of   f.
(b)      With   a   starting   point   of   (0,   0)T,   apply   two   iterations   of Newton’s   method.
(c)    Repeat part (b)   with   the method of   steepest descent but   with   ﬁxed step size   α   =   0.05.
